## About
SpeQL8 enables you to run GraphQL queries on an existing Postgres database and collect request-response metrics per query.  View and compare query response times from both your database and from a lightning fast Redis cache, all in the comfort and security of your local development environment.

Upload a .sql or .tar file to spin up your postgres database from SpeQL8 or simply plug in a Postgres database client URL (e.g. ElephantSQL).

___
## Get Started With SpeQL8:
You can either spin up locally on your own machine, or inside a Docker container:
A) Local Install
* Fork and clone this repository
* Ensure you have an instance of Redis Server active.
* Run npm install && npm build && npm start
* Open localhost:3333

B) Containerized
* Fork and clone this repository
* In the SpeQL8 root directory, run the command `npm run speql8`
* Open localhost:3333
* please note - creating GraphQL API instances from a .sql or .tar file is a forthcoming feature in the containerized version

## Prerequisites
