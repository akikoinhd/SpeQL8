# SpeQL8
SpeQL8 enables you to run GraphQL queries on an existing postgres database and collect request-response metrics per query.  View and compare query response times from both your database and from a lightning fast Redis cache.


Upload a .sql or .tar file to spin up your postgres database from SpeQL8 or simply plug in a Postgres database client URL (e.g. ElephantSQL).
